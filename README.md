# Discrete-Fourier-Transform
Computing DFT matrix (rarely done in practice). Will also use FFT to find DFT which is what people normally do. Based off of Steve Brunton's book: Data Driven Science &amp; Engineering: Machine Learning, Dynamical Systems, and Control by S. L. Brunton and J. N. Kutz Cambridge Textbook, 2019.
